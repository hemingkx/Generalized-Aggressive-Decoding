Gut@@ ach : Incre@@ ased safety for pedestri@@ ans
They are not even 100 metres apart : On Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian lights in Dorf@@ park@@ platz in Gut@@ ach became operational - within view of the existing Town Hall traffic lights .
Two sets of lights so close to one another : inten@@ tional or just a sil@@ ly error ?
